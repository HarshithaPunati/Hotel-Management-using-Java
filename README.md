The project is a Hotel Management System that helps in managing hotel room bookings, customer details, food orders, and other hotel-related operations. It provides a basic structure for handling different types of rooms, booking processes, food orders, and billing while ensuring that data input follows the required validation rules.

Key Features of the Project

Room Booking and Management:

The system allows booking different types of rooms: Luxury Double Rooms, Deluxe Double Rooms, Luxury Single Rooms, and Deluxe Single Rooms.
Each room type can be booked for one or two occupants based on availability.
Customer Information Handling:

Display and Modify Bookings:

Provides the ability to display all booked rooms, showing the current status of hotel occupancy.
The system can show the current orders of a specific room and allows modifications, ensuring customers have a flexible experience.
Technologies and Concepts Used

Java Programming Language: The project is implemented in Java, utilizing OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and exception handling.
Serialization: Used to store and manage data in a structured way.

Data Structures: Utilizes ArrayList and arrays to manage room data and food orders efficiently.
